### **ABOUT ME**

I've just finished JS/frontend Pre-School course and I'm really love it! I'm full of enthusiasm about my future education.

I know that now it won't be so easy, but I'm ready for the challenge.

For the last three months I've learned a lot of stuff and look straight forward to discover new horizons.

I grateful for all creators, mentors, activists and all of my colleagues-students for this opportunity, support and amazing experience!
