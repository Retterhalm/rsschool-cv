# Denis Kuznetsov aka Retterhalm

Hi!

My name is Denis, I've just finished JS/Frontend Pre-school course at [RS School](https://rs.school/) and currently start the main course.

 Looking forward to the end of September 2023 when I see me owing a certificate.

 I've been trying a lot of courses before but this particularly is AWESOME!

 Thanks to amazing educational system that in my opinion should be integrated by main colleges!

 Okay, let's  see how it will be ;)
